Penguin themed labyrinth game for iPhone. Made for EECS 493, University of Michigan

Authors: Luke Platz, Jacob Gerstler, Riley Chapin

-Saving game state (level progress, scores, mid-level quit?)

-How we want scoring to be set up? (Time-based, end-goal based, little *star* checkpoints that you collect as you progress?, some combination of these?)

-Better physics/obstacles/powerups
	-Grow/Shrink?
	-Fly?
	
-Better code organization (button class, HUD class, obstacle class (with custom size), powerup class)

-Multiple Levels, and progression between them

Endless Mode: alternate between picking between 2 powerups, then the next obstacle uses the powerup you chose.
